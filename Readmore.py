# Time-Series Readme
# ===============================================================================

# Examples:

# 1. A retailer may be interested in predicting future sales at an SKU level for planning and budgeting. 2. A small
# merchant may be interested in forecasting sales by store, so it can schedule the right resources (more people
# during busy periods and vice versa). 3. A software giant like Google may be interested in knowing the busiest hour
# of the day or busiest day of the week so that it can schedule server resources accordingly. 4. The health
# department may be interested in predicting the cumulative COVID vaccination administered so that it can know the
# point of consolidation where herd immunity is expected to kick in.
