'''
-Need to better transform these data:
 You could look at stabilizing the variance by applying  
 the cube root for neg and pos values and then 
 difference the data 
-You might compare models with different AR and MA terms
-This is a very small sample size of 24 timestamps, 
 so might not have enough to spare for a holdout set 
 To get more use out of your data for training, rolling over time 
 series or timestamps at a time for different holdout sets
 allows for training on more timestamps; doesn't stop the model from 
 capturing the last chunk of timestamps stored in a single holdout set
-The data only looks at 24 hours in one day
 Would we start to capture more of a trend in hourly sentiment if we 
 collected data over several days?
 How would you go about collecting more data?

 Take on the challenge and further improve this model:
 You have been given a head start, now take this example
 and improve on it!

 To study time series further:
-Look at model diagnostics
-Using AIC to search best model parameters 
-Handle any datetime data issues
-Try other modeling techniques
